You can rename a `.sh` file using the `mv` (move) command in the terminal:
### ðŸ“¦ Syntax:

````bash
mv old-name.sh new-name.sh
````

### âœ… Example:

If your file is named `sync-wrong-name.sh` and you want to rename it to `sync-guides-windows.sh`, youâ€™d do:
````bash
mv sync-wrong-name.sh sync-guides-windows.sh
````

Thatâ€™s it! The file is now renamed.
