### Environment Description

The windswept cliffs loom above crashing waves, their jagged edges dotted with massive nests of driftwood and whalebone. Scattered feathers, each as long as a sword, catch in the salt-stained grass. A faint screech echoes from the cloudsâ€”something large is hunting. Watch for shadows overhead. (479/480)

### Battlemap Prompt

A top-down drone shot of a crumbling stone watchtower perched on a jagged mountain peak. A winding cliffside path, a hidden cave entrance, and a rickety rope bridge are present. Swirling mist clings to the rocks, and distant thunder rumbles across the peaks. Battlemap style, hand-painted digital illustration, moody twilight lighting, no photorealism. Focused detail on the tower's broken battlements and precarious wooden scaffolding.
