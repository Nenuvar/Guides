### Environment Description

Deep in the fungal-choked gloom, a crumbling altar of black stone rises from the mist, its surface etched with pulsating green runes. Gnarled mycelial roots coil through the ruins like grasping fingers, their bioluminescent tendrils casting eerie reflections in the stagnant pool below. The air thrums with whispered echoesâ€”until a hulking bugbear emerges from the fog, its matted fur glistening with phosphorescent spores, yellowed claws flexing as it snarl

### Battlemap Prompt

A top-down drone shot of a crumbling stone altar located in a misty, overgrown glade. Gnarled roots snaking through the ruins, faint glowing runes carved into the stone, and a pool of dark water reflecting the moonlight are present. Shifting tendrils of fog, and the distant sound of whispering leaves enhance the mood. Battlemap style, hand-painted digital illustration, eerie blue-green lighting, no photorealism. Focused detail on the ritual circle etched into the altar.
