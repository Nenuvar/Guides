### Environment Description

The wind-swept cliffs loom above crashing waves, their jagged edges dotted with tufts of coarse, golden feathers. Scattered bones—seal, dolphin, and something larger—nestle between tide-smoothed rocks. High above, a shadow glides across the sun, and the distant cry of a raptor echoes off the stone. A fresh perch-mark, deep talon grooves in the rockface, still smells of salt and iron.

### Battlemap Prompt

A top-down drone shot of a crumbling stone altar located on a windswept coastal cliff. Jagged rock spires, scattered shipwreck debris, and arcane runes carved into the stone are present. Roaring ocean spray, and circling storm petrels enhance the mood. Battlemap style, hand-painted digital illustration, stormy twilight lighting, no photorealism. Focused detail on the ritual circle at the altar's base.
