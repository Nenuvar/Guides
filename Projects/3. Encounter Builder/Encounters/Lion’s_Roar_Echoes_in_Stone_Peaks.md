### Environment Description

The sun-scorched dunes ripple like a golden sea, their crests etched with faint, windblown tracks. A skeletal acacia offers scant shade, its bark clawed by powerful talons. Nearby, a sun-bleached skull—antelope—rests between deep paw prints. The air carries a musky tang, and tufts of tawny fur cling to thorny scrub. A distant, resonant growl echoes through the canyon, vanishing like a mirage.

### Battlemap Prompt

A top-down drone shot of a crumbling stone watchtower located on a jagged mountain peak. Steep cliffside paths, scattered boulders, and a rickety rope bridge are present. Swirling mist and distant eagle cries enhance the mood. Battlemap style, hand-painted digital illustration, cold dawn lighting, no photorealism. Focused detail on the tower’s fractured foundation.
