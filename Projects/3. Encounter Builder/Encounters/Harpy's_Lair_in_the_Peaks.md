### Environment Description

The wind carries a faint, discordant hum over the jagged cliffs. Feathers—some iridescent, others dull—litter the sandy ground, wedged between seashells. Scratches mar the rocks, too precise for nature. A distant cackle dances on the breeze, gone as soon as heard. Salt and something muskier linger in the air. Tattered ribbons flutter from a lone, splintered mast—too high for any but winged hands to reach.

### Battlemap Prompt

A high-angle view of a rugged mountain peak, where a narrow cliffside path winds precariously along the edge. Jagged rock formations, a crumbling stone bridge, and a hidden cave entrance are present. A fierce blizzard rages, and distant thunder echoes through the peaks. Battlemap style, hand-painted digital illustration, dramatic lighting, no photorealism. Focused detail on the treacherous path and bridge.
