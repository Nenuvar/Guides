### Environment Description

The jagged cliffs tower above a foaming, sulfur-scented tide. Razor-shell fragments litter the sand, their edges carved with faint, spiraling glyphs. Scaled footprints—larger than a human’s, webbed—lead to a tidepool where a jagged obsidian dagger juts from a rotting shark carcass. The water whispers with unseen voices. (280/480)

### Battlemap Prompt

**Undersea Ruins Battlemap**  

A sunken temple, overgrown with coral and kelp, lies half-buried in shifting sands. Towering stone pillars, carved with ancient glyphs, tilt precariously. Schools of bioluminescent fish dart through shattered archways. A massive clam glows faintly in the center, guarding secrets within. Dark crevices hint at lurking predators, while shafts of sunlight pierce the depths, casting eerie, dancing patterns on the ruins. The current carries whispers of forgotten gods. (480/480)
