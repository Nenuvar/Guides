### Environment Description

A scorching wind howls through the dunes, carrying the faint stench of decay. Tracks—massive, three-toed—crisscross the sand, leading to a half-buried ribcage, cracked and splintered as if gnawed by monstrous jaws. Nearby, a tuft of coarse yellow fur clings to a jagged rock, twitching in the breeze. The laughter of unseen creatures echoes just beyond the shimmering haze.

### Battlemap Prompt

A low-angle close-up of a weathered stone monolith standing on a windswept grassland. Frayed prayer flags, scattered wildflowers, and a cracked altar are present. Distant thunder rumbles, and the scent of rain lingers in the air. Battlemap style, hand-painted digital illustration, moody twilight lighting, no photorealism. Focused detail on the ancient runes carved into the monolith.
